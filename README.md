Jacob Trader's Notes on Simon: HTML
#   While doing this assignment, I thought alot about the meta tag in the head section of the html page
#   I also found it interesting how you used tables to display infomration. I can't wait to learn how to update them dynamically

#Notes on Simon: CSS
#   It was cool to see how much the website changed with just a little bit of bootstrap

#Notes on Simon: JS
#   It was interesting to see asyc in action. I am still a bit hazy on what it does exactly but this gave me a little bit more understanding for what it does

Notes on Simon: Services
  I learned that it is possilble to use outside data not already stored within the files of the project and display it within the website. I can't wait to use this ablitiy within my own website
 
 Notes on Simon: Database
  I learned that it is important to make sure you set up the database correctly to allow for IP address from anywhere to access it (when that is required)
    I also learned how objects are stored inside the database and how to use queries to call for data
 
 Notes on Simon: Log-in
  I leaned how important it is to make sure all of the approprate npm modules are to installing. I also learned more about what async and await (specifically what they do and don't do) 

#Devin Sheldon's Notes
#   I learned that a good way to avoid merge conflicts is to work on separate files at the same time.
