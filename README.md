Jacob Trader's Notes on Simon: HTML
#   While doing this assignment, I thought alot about the meta tag in the head section of the html page
#   I also found it interesting how you used tables to display infomration. I can't wait to learn how to update them dynamically

#Notes on Simon: CSS
#   It was cool to see how much the website changed with just a little bit of bootstrap

#Notes on Simon: JS
#   It was interesting to see asyc in action. I am still a bit hazy on what it does exactly but this gave me a little bit more understanding for what it does
