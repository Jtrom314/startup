# Hello Github1
# Hello Github2
# It is so cool to be able to change things on my computer and have 
# them be published to the cloud. I learned how to save, commmit, 
# pull, and resolve conflicts.

# ELEVATOR PITCH:
# Have you ever wondered what other people thought about something? 
# Have you ever wanted to know how your opinions stack up against git
# everyone else's? Well, now you can know! We have created a site
# called y/n.io that normal people like you and me can vote
# on several hot-button topcis and see what percentage of people
# made the same choice! Some opinions will be popular, while other
# topics will be a controversial 50/50 split! Wheter you are 
# mainstream or unique, you opinion counts!

Jacob Trader's Notes on Simon: HTML
#   While doing this assignment, I thought alot about the meta tag in the head section of the html page
#   I also found it interesting how you used tables to display infomration. I can't wait to learn how to update them dynamically

#Notes on Simon: CSS
#   It was cool to see how much the website changed with just a little bit of bootstrap

#Notes on Simon: JS
#   It was interesting to see asyc in action. I am still a bit hazy on what it does exactly but this gave me a little bit more understanding for what it does

Notes on Startup JS:
Had a fun time working with objects and async functions. It was fun trying to figure out a solution to storing user response locally in a way that made sense to me while also looking out for what is to come in the future with data bases and other services.

Notes on Simon: Services
  I learned that it is possilble to use outside data not already stored within the files of the project and display it within the website. I can't wait to use this ablitiy within my own website
 
 Notes on Simon: Database
  I learned that it is important to make sure you set up the database correctly to allow for IP address from anywhere to access it (when that is required)
    I also learned how objects are stored inside the database and how to use queries to call for data
 
 Notes on Simon: Log-in
  I leaned how important it is to make sure all of the approprate npm modules are to installing. I also learned more about what async and await (specifically what they do and don't do) 
  
  Notes on Startup:
    I learned that it is really good to plan things well in advance if I can. I also learned that it isn't a bad idea to throw in an extra div or two in areas that might need work done in the future (targeting for js, css etc). 
  
Notes on Simon: Websocket
I learned what it means to Ping/Pong between the server and client. It was cool to see what that looked like (while debugging it) and what it looked like on the front end of things

Notes on Startup: Services
I think the biggest thing that I learned was how to debug things that happen over the network. I learned about endpoints and their uses to interact with the backend of a server and what it does to data being sent. I learned about headers and different network protocals that the server uses to move data along.
 

#Devin Sheldon's Notes
#   I learned that a good way to avoid merge conflicts is to work on separate files at the same time.
